# T-DB Studio & Agency: 2026 Revised Strategy

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the strategic pivot for 2026, transitioning from a subscription-heavy, mass-market approach to a **boutique, relationship-driven model**. The focus is on high-touch design via **T-DB Studio** to build reputation and cash flow, followed by a transition to custom branding retainers and full agency services under **The-DrawingBoard**.

## Why This Model Works (Nigeria 2026 Context)

### 1. Market Alignment
- **Premium Branding**: SMBs and startups in Nigeria prioritize trust and outcome-driven work over commoditized subscriptions.
- **Custom Pricing**: Allows charging based on ROI and value (e.g., better positioning and growth).
- **Competitive Edge**: Agency entry points (₦500k–₦1M+) are optimized for premium custom work.

### 2. Operational Efficiency
- **Minimal Team**: 1 Creative Director (You), 1 In-house Designer, 1 Remote Admin/PR.
- **Scalability**: Use project-based freelancers (₦100k/project) for execution overflow without increasing fixed overhead.
- **Client Capacity**: Focused on 3-5 high-quality brands per month.

### 3. Revenue Stability
- **Retainer Model**: Transitioning to monthly retainers (~₦300k/client) ensures predictable, recurring income.
- **95% Retention**: Deep trust and exclusivity (waiting list) minimize churn and the need for constant client acquisition.
